# CarDealershipDemo
C#.NET Web API project w/ React

## About
This is a project demonstrating the implmentation of a single-page application with a backend API.
The frontend is built using React and Bootstrap, and the backend is a .NET (Core) web API. 
Dependency injection and unit testing are also demonstrated in the code base. For simplicity purposes, a backend data repository is omitted.

## Live Demo
